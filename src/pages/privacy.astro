        Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard
        technology called ‘cookies’ (see explanation below) and server logs to
        collect information about how our site is used. Information gathered through
        cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages
        viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited just before and
        just after our own, as well as your IP address.

        We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our website. Google Analytics
        gathers information about website use by means of cookies. The information
        gathered relating to our website is used to create reports about the use
        of our website. Google’s privacy policy is available at:

        Use of Cookies
      </h3>
      <p>
        A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous
        unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks
        your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard
        drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own
        cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to
        protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the
        cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other
        sites.
      </p>
      <h3 id="IP_Addresses">
        IP Addresses
      </h3>
      <p>
        IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to
        the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on
        the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected
        by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic
        data” so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
